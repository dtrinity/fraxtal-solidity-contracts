# CLAUDE.md - Memento Protocol Router

This file serves as a minimal router for Claude Code. Instructions are loaded on-demand from the .memento directory.

## Available Commands

ðŸš¨ IMPORTANT: Always Check for Mode First. 
WHEN YOU START A MODE please output: `Mode: [mode-name]`
WHEN YOU START A WORKFLOW please output: `Workflow: [workflow-name]`

## Session Start Protocol

AT THE START OF EVERY SESSION:
1. Check if user specified a mode
2. If NO mode specified:
   - Output: `Mode: autonomous-project-manager`
   - Read `.memento/modes/autonomous-project-manager.md`
   - State: "Activating default autonomous project manager mode"
3. Proceed with task following mode guidelines

## MODE ACTIVATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

When a mode is requested or implied:
1. IMMEDIATELY output: `Mode: [mode-name]`
2. THEN read the mode file: `.memento/modes/[mode-name].md`
3. CONFIRM activation by stating: "I am now operating in [mode-name] mode"
4. ONLY THEN proceed with the task

CRITICAL: You MUST complete ALL steps above before taking ANY other action.

You can take on one of modes in `.memento/modes`
- `ai-debt-maintainer`
- `architect`
- `autonomous-project-manager`
- `engineer`
- `reviewer`

Each mode includes specific example commands and use cases - check the mode file for details.

## Mode Behavior Enforcement

Once in a mode, you MUST:
- Follow ALL guidelines in the mode file

## Mode Persistence

IMPORTANT: Once a mode is activated:
- You remain in that mode for the ENTIRE request until the next user interaction
- To switch modes, user must explicitly request it
- If unsure about current mode, re-read the mode file

### Execute a Workflow
There are battle tested step-by-step flows in `.memento/workflows`. You must execute these when asked, or when you think it will increase task reliability. You can treat these as additional tools at your disposal.
Example workflow invocations: `execute summarize` / `execute summarize workflow` / `workflow summarize` / `summarize workflow` - These should all trigger `./memento/workflows/summarize.md`
The full list of workflows is in the `.memento/workflows` directory. When asked to execute a workflow, check there for available workflows and pick up the one that matches.

### Work with Tickets
To manage complex or long running work, please persist context in `.memento/tickets/`
- Tickets are in 3 directories, `next` `done` and `in-progress`
- You must move tickets to their respective directory based on status at the end of a run
- You should use tickets to share context between sub-agents or to coordinate parallel agents
- Each agent must add their updates to their respective ticket before finishing

## Component Location
All components are in the `.memento/` directory:
- **Modes**: `.memento/modes/[mode-name].md`
- **Workflows**: `.memento/workflows/[workflow-name].md`
- **Tickets**: `.memento/tickets/[status]/[ticket-id]/`
