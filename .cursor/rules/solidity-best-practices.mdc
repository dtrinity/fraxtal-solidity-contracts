# Always
- Use OpenZeppelin when possible
- Ensure that the Solidity version matches other files in the same directory or nearby directories
- Verify that security best practices are met, think about potential exploits, attacks, and mistakes that can be made
- Add test coverage when creating new logic, or modify existing tests when making edits. Hardhat tests are under the `test/` directory and mirror the contracts directory structure
- When using `console.log` in Solidity for debugging, please import "hardhat/console.sol"
